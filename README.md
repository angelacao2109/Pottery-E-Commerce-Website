## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js / TailwindCSS / Bootstrap
- **Backend**:  Python with Django / Axios
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Supabase
- **Payments**: Stripe API
- **Shipping Integration**: Shippo, EasyPost, SendCloud, ShipStation, Postmen by AfterShip
- **Hosting**:  AWS
- **Testing**:  PyTest

### Why was this stack chosen?

- **React.js:** allows for fast rendering and interactive UIs, essential for a smooth user experience in e-commerce. TailwindCSS and Bootstrap provide responsive, customizable design components for scalability across devices.

- **Django:** offers a secure, scalable backend with built-in authentication, security, and an admin panel for managing products and orders. Axios simplifies frontend-backend communication.

- **PostgreSQL**: is reliable for structured data, while Supabase provides real-time features and easy authentication, enhancing development efficiency.

- **Stripe:** is chosen for its seamless integration and strong security.

- Integrating services like Shippo and EasyPost automates label generation and tracking, improving fulfillment.

- **AWS:** offers scalable, reliable cloud hosting, ideal for handling traffic spikes.

- **PyTest:** is used for backend testing, ensuring reliability in code and APIs.

### Other stacks that were considered:

- **Vue.js:** Vue was considered for its simplicity and ease of use, especially for smaller applications. While Vue offers great reactivity and is beginner-friendly, React's ecosystem, scalability, and job market demand made it a better fit for this project.

- **Flask:** A lightweight Python framework was considered for smaller-scale use cases but lacked the built-in features (like authentication and admin) that Django offers for rapid e-commerce development.

- **Node.js** (with Express): Full-stack JavaScript was considered for consistency in frontend and backend development, but Django's built-in security, scalability, and robust admin tools made it more suitable for this project.

- **NoSQL** (e.g., MongoDB): NoSQL databases like MongoDB were evaluated for flexibility with unstructured data. However, the structured nature of e-commerce data (products, orders, users) made PostgreSQL a better option, ensuring relational data consistency and reliability.

Other Hosting Options:

- **Heroku:** A simpler alternative, but AWS offers more control and scalability.

- **Vercel:** Considered for frontend hosting, but AWS provides full-stack control.

- **DigitalOcean:** Simple to use and affordable but lacks some advanced features of AWS.

Other Payment Options:

- **PayPal:** Considered for its user-friendly payment process, but Stripe was chosen for its lower fees and developer-friendly API.

- **Square:** Evaluated, but Stripeâ€™s API flexibility made it more suitable.

- **Shopify:** Shopify was considered as a hosted e-commerce solution for ease of setup, but the fees were a lot higher than Stripe.
